    <h3>Beyond the pavilion long,
        Beside the ancient way,
        The fragrant grass spreads green, reaching up to the sky</h3>
    <p>Thoughts in the Silent Night
        Before my bed a pool of light,
        I wonder if it's frost upon the ground.
        I raise my head and look at the bright moon,
        Then bow my head and think of my far-off hometown..</p>
    <p class="highlight">Looking on Spring in the Capital
        Though a country be sundered, hills and rivers endure;
        And spring comes green again to trees and grasses there.
        In grief for the times, even flowers bring tears to my eyes;
        Hating to be parted, hearing birds alarms my heart.
        The beacon fires have been burning for three months on end;
        A letter from home is worth a fortune in gold.
        My grizzled hair grows even shorter with all my worrying,
        Too thin to hold the hairpins any more.</p>
